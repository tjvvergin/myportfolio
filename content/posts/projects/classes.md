## Low-Level C and C++ Classes

In these classes we focused on understanding the low level assembly code and compiler logic that makes modern programs work. In Systems 1 and 2 and Compiler Design, where we learned these things, we did projects like the bomb project where you needed to step through assembly code to complete the puzzle without setting off a bomb in the codeâ€”which would send a message to the professor and dock points.

As well, I took a class titled Optimized C++ where we learned tricks to make code run faster in C++. I actually made a whole page dedicated to this which you can find [here](/posts/projects/cpp).

## Computer Forensic and Incident Response

In this class we learned about some of the tools and methods people use to recover deleted data. The course covers topics such as the FAT and NTFS file systems, Autopsy, and the Linux operating system, all designed to familiarize students with lower-level operations in operating systems. This was a very interesting class where I learned a lot about Linux on top of what I already knew about the Bash shell from other classes.

## Design and Analysis of Algorithms

In this advanced class I learned a lot about what makes an algorithm great. We covered topics including Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Run-Time Analysis of Algorithms, Sorting Algorithms, Searching Algorithms, and Graph Algorithms. I learned how to structure and properly test algorithms to ensure scalable solutions to real-world problems.

## Learning Git

In my Global Software Development class, we focused on learning how to use Git through GitHub and other Global Software Development tools like Git's Kanban feature. We also learned about the software development lifecycle with practical examples.

## My Pre-requisite Major Classes

In several pre-requisite classes, I learned a lot about how modern computing is done. I learned all about object-oriented programming and the data structures that make up the backbone of many modern programs. During this time, I gained extensive experience with the Java programming language, which has served as the foundation for much of my later learning.

## Database Systems

In my Database Systems class, I learned a lot about normalized and relational databases as well as SQL. We used the Oracle SQL program throughout the course.

## iOS App Development

In the two classes I took, I learned a lot about making iOS apps using both UIKit Storyboards and SwiftUI. I have a page dedicated to the final projects of these classes [here to read more on](/posts/projects/GoDex).

## Web Design Classes

I've taken multiple web design classes at DePaul in an effort to broaden my horizons. Some notable ones include Interactive Web Scripting and Web Design 1. In both of these classes, the main focus was on creating modern webpages using tools like Express, MongoDB, and Node, along with learning JavaScript to make more interactive web pages.
