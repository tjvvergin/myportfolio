## GoDex and Object Oriented Programming Using UIKit
GoDex is an app used to track the The first GoDex was the final project for my iOS app development 1 class which covered programming using UIKit and storyboards. GoDex was also my first large programming project which was made significantly easier by also taking the object oriented programming class at the same time. I already had knowledge of data structures and certain important algorithms but the knolwledge of how to put everything I had learned already into one big project was invaluable. My object oriented class also taught me how to diagram which was incredibly useful for the next project.

## GoDexPro the Successor
GoDexPro is the successor to GoDex using SwiftUI and several other Apple libraries. It has built in web browsing capabilities using WebKit and many other diagramming utilities using SwiftCharts. This is the most complicated solo project I have worked on solo and served as my final project for the iOS App Development class at DePaul. It contains more detailed data handling than the previous project and can fetch and display any Pokemon from Pokemon Go using the returned json data from pogoapi.net. There are detailed button animations for multiple functions in the app and it stores all data the user inputs so that they can keep track of what they have and not.
