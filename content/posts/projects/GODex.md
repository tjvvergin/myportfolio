## GoDex and Object Oriented Programming
The first GoDex was the final project for my iOS app development 1 class. It was also my first large programming project which was made significantly easier by also taking the object oriented programming class at the same time. I already had knowledge of data structures and certain important algorithms but the knolwledge of how to put everything I had learned already into one big project was invaluable. My object oriented class also taught me how to diagram which was incredibly useful as well.
