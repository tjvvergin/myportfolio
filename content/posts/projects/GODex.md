## GoDex and Object Oriented Programming Using UIKit

The original GoDex app was developed as my final project for the "iOS App Development I" class, where I gained hands-on experience programming with UIKit and Storyboards. GoDex was also my first major programming endeavor, made considerably more manageable thanks to concurrent coursework in Object-Oriented Programming.

While I was already familiar with fundamental data structures and algorithms, integrating this knowledge into a cohesive, large-scale project provided invaluable experience. Additionally, my Object-Oriented Programming course taught me critical diagramming skills, significantly streamlining development and preparation for future projects.

## GoDex-Pro: Advanced SwiftUI Application Development

GoDex-Pro, the successor to GoDex, represents a complete redesign using SwiftUI and other advanced Apple libraries. It incorporates enhanced features, including integrated web browsing capabilities powered by WebKit, and sophisticated diagramming functionalities via SwiftCharts.

GoDex-Pro demonstrates more complex data handling, capable of dynamically fetching and displaying Pokémon data from Pokémon Go using JSON responses provided by pogoapi.net. Notable UI enhancements include detailed button animations for various interactive elements, such as marking Pokémon as caught and storing that data locally. Serving as my final project in the advanced iOS App Development course at DePaul, GoDex-Pro stands as my most complex and comprehensive solo programming achievement to date.

## GoDex Pro Pictures

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="/images/godex-pro-index.png" alt="A picture of the GoDex Pro index page" style="width: 45%;">
  <img src="/images/godex-pro-bulbasaur.png" alt="A picture of the GoDex Pro individual pokemon page" style="width: 45%;">
</div>


The picture on the left is of the GoDex Pro pokemon index page and shows the pokemon ordered by their ids. Bulbasaur has been marked as "caught" indicated by the green checkmark and has been marked as "caught shiny" indicated by the yellow sparkle indicator. In the right picture you can see the individual stats of the pokemon such as the typing, weight, gender distribution, height, and average stats as compared to the average stats of all pokemon. The user is also able to swipe through the pictures to see all of the variants that exist of the pokemon in this screen as indicated by the slide-show selector dots on the bottom. As well the backgrounds and borders of all pokemon are a gradient whose color is determined by the typing of the pokemon.
