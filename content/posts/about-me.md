### Introduction {#introduction}

 #### Hi, I’m Tyler Vergin – Software Developer & Problem Solver

I'm only a few months away from graduating with a degree in Computer Science from DePaul University, and I’m driven by the challenge of creating efficient and scalable software. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects, and I bring a fresh perspective, along with strong skills in object oriented programming languages and problem solving.

Whether it’s optimizing algorithms, building responsive web apps, or diving into full-stack development, I’m ready to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

What I believe to be my strongest skill is problem solving. Whether problem solving away a bug intruduced by a new feature or problem solving how to get my sink to stop leaking, I am always looking for a new problem to solve. Much of this skills that I have developed are due to my naturally curious brain trying to think of solutions. This aspect about myself is what landed me a job fixing phones and other electronics in a retail environment at the age of 16 and kept me as one of their top employees for 4 years.
