# About Me

Hi, I'm Tyler Vergin—a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate from DePaul University and a dedicated Software Developer. I thrive on creating efficient, scalable solutions that make a real impact. My academic journey has given me a solid foundation in both theory and practice, and I'm a fast learner who quickly adapts to new technologies.

My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of technology. I’ve honed my skills in object-oriented programming with languages like Java, C++, Swift, and Python, and I’m comfortable tackling challenges in C, Scala, Scheme, and MySQL. I constantly seek opportunities to expand my technical toolkit and master emerging tools with enthusiasm.

I excel at solving complex problems—whether it’s debugging intricate code or devising practical solutions for everyday challenges. Starting as a professional phone and electronics repair technician at 16, I developed a knack for rapid learning and creative problem solving that has driven my commitment to excellence and lifelong learning.

Beyond programming, I bring strong teamwork, communication, and IT expertise to fast-paced environments. With experience in agile methodologies, Git, and modern development practices, I contribute effectively to collaborative projects while maintaining exceptional attention to detail. I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges in technology.
