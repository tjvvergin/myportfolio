      <description>About Me Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Tyler Vergin—a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate from DePaul University and a dedicated Software Developer. I thrive on creating efficient, scalable solutions that make a real impact. My academic journey has given me a solid foundation in both theory and practice, and I&amp;rsquo;m a fast learner who quickly adapts to new technologies.
My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of technology. I’ve honed my skills in object-oriented programming with languages like Java, C++, Swift, and Python, and I’m comfortable tackling challenges in C, Scala, Scheme, and MySQL.</description>

      <description>Github Link My philosophy of what makes a good website: I have always been fascinated with how people use the programs that they do on a daily basis. As a technophile who likes to use programs which both look nice and function well I first considered going into website design when entering college. Website design was my original ambitions until I took some more advanced classes and noticed that it was not the actual user interface but the streamlining of workflows which actually interested me.</description>

Final Project Documentation My app is a continuation from my project from last quarter GoDex. My new app GoDex Pro is designed to take all of the best things from the previous app and make them both more usable and look better, as well as add a few new features using SwiftUI. GoDex Pro is a Pokémon Go Pokédex companion app that serves as a better version of the in-game Pokédex which provides far more information.</description>

GoDex Pro Research Paper
Abstract:
This paper explores the complex weave of technologies used in the creation of the GoDex Pro app, a resource for Pokémon Go players. The use of the data-driven SwiftUI framework, along with Swift Charts and WebKit functionality, allowed for the development of a dynamic and engaging user interface. The history of iOS development is also discussed, tracing its evolution from the use of the Cocoa UI framework and Objective-C programming language to the introduction of Swift and SwiftUI.</description>
